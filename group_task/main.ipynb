    "## Introduction\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "You are supposed to build at least five machine learning models from these data to predict or\n",
    "classify one relevant target feature for new data points. You can choose target feature yourself, but\n",
    "sales price is perhaps the most suitable. You may also reduce the number of data points somewhat\n",
    "by focusing on only specific meaningful parts of the data. Or perhaps you will try dimension\n",
    "reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "This task can be split into four parts:\n",
    "- **Part 1** Data Exploration\n",
    "- **Part 2** Data Cleaning\n",
    "- **Part 3** Model Building\n",
    "- **Part 4** Presentation and Analysation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore our data by conducting a *Exploratory Data Analysis*. Here we will look at the data and make note of important features, non important features, and in general inform ourselves with the data. In part 2, we will generally clean the data, remove empty or unique columns and so on. In part 3 we will start to fit the models, we will also change the data in preparation of each model. And at last we will present the results, and analyze the different approaches we took with out models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen two supervised machine learning algorythms:\n",
    "- Algorythm 1\n",
    "- Algorythm 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Two unsupervised machine learning algorythms:\n",
    "- Algorythm 3\n",
    "- Algotythm 4\n",

    "and one Deep Learnign algorytm:\n",
