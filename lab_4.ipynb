    "One of the techniques often used in machine learning is cross-validation. There is a lot about that in the text book in section 5.1. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a method will generalize. It is particularly used much when you have small data sets, and also when you want to find out what parameters you should use in your machine learning model.The tasks this week is to:\n",
    "1. Run ordinary regression on the boston data set. What is $R^2$? Does it overfit?\n",
    "2. Run Lasso and Ridge regression on the boston data set. You can also use the extended boston data set provided in the mglearn package. What is $R^2$ with various alphas foreach of Ridge and Lasso? How much are they overfitting?\n",
    "3. Now read about cross-validation, and run a cross-validation approach on Lasso and Ridge methods using the boston data set. What parameters of alpha leads to best average $R^2$? Also check the training set scores for each fold by getting results from scikitâ€™s `cross_validate` method. What are your preferred values for alpha for Ridge and Lasso?"
